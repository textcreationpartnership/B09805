            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>PROPOSALS <hi>To this present Convention.</hi> For the perpetual Security of the Protestant Religion, AND THE Liberty of the Subects of England, Humbly Offer'd By the Author of the <hi>BREVIATE.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>AFTER the Great Blessings that seem designed for the whole Nation, from the happy agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between the <hi>Two Houses,</hi> in that great Point before them, the <hi>Vacancy of the Throne;</hi> I cannot, but crave Pardon and leave to put the <hi>Representatives</hi> of the Nation in remembrance, that though this <hi>Vacating</hi> of the Throne opens so large a Door to our Great and many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances, yet our lasting Security is not intirely compleated here; and that therefore they baulk not the next Point, which is as stoutly to be asserted, viz. <hi>That the Power now of setling the</hi> Government, <hi>and sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the</hi> Vacancy, <hi>is reverted to the</hi> Community, <hi>whereof they are the</hi> Representatives. This is an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty we are like never to have again in the World; and a Precedent ought to be made for the Ages to come. It is not to be thought, after an agreement on the first Point, but that this <hi>Convention</hi> is willing to invest the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> with the Government, during his Life; (for they say, both the <hi>Princesses</hi> are willing it should be so, and no prejudice to either:) But how this can be orderly done, untill the <hi>Power</hi> be asserted; let the Wisdom of the Nation consider, and lay it well to Heart.</p>
            <p>There is One main objection. If the <hi>Convention</hi> choose a <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen</hi> at this Time, then will the <hi>Government</hi> be for ever <hi>Elective;</hi> But this is a great Mistake; for, we must know it is the <hi>Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of a <hi>Government,</hi> which makes it <hi>Elective</hi> or <hi>Hereditary,</hi> and not One <hi>Actual Choice,</hi> or <hi>single Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</hi> This being (note that well) by a Convention not a Parliament; whilst in the present Juncture, that Vacancy in the Throne (which may never happen again to the End of the World,) Leaves us no other Expedient of reestablishing our <hi>Government,</hi> then by Electing Our <hi>Governour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When an <hi>Heredetary Kingdom</hi> is set up that was none before, the Person on Necessity must be by <hi>Election</hi> at first; though at the same time, the Compact of Obedience to the Person so Elected, and to his Heirs in Sucession after him, may be such, that what at first was in the peoples <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Right</hi> to give, after submission payd, will never lye in their Power to resume back. The Case is the same here. And if we understand then, when it is resolved, that the <hi>Throne</hi> is vacant, or <hi>Government</hi> dissolved, (which is all one) the meaning is not, that the <hi>Constitution</hi> of the <hi>Government</hi> is dissolved (for therefore is it so warily exprest) but the <hi>Government</hi> in the <hi>Administration.</hi> It is Essential to Government to have <hi>pars Imperans,</hi> and <hi>pars subdita;</hi> and the <hi>pars Imperans</hi> failing (as in our Case) the Government is Not; that is, it is dissolved so, as there can be no Exercise of it, till it be setled again: Nothing that the <hi>King</hi> can do, or <hi>Parliament</hi> can do, can vacate the <hi>Constitution:</hi> It is <hi>That</hi> they both <hi>Derive</hi> from and <hi>hold</hi> by. Only the <hi>Community</hi> being those, as first <hi>made</hi> it, (it must be confest) they can <hi>dissolve</hi> it, or <hi>Change</hi> it, if they think fit. The <hi>King</hi> hath not yet dissolv'd it, but the <hi>Convention</hi> (being, upon the Dissolution of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, in the Exercise call'd this together, as Deputies of the <hi>Community,</hi> to set <hi>that</hi> up,) may do so: or what is better; they may confirm the <hi>Fundamental Points</hi> of it, and Mend the Rest, as they see good. It were then Adviseable, both for the Honour and Safety of the Nation. That the <hi>Convention</hi> did agree and declare, that the Government of <hi>England</hi> be still an <hi>Hereditary Limited Monarchy;</hi> with this change only, that the Descent of the <hi>Crown,</hi> be bound to a <hi>Protestant.</hi> This salves the Objection for ever.</p>
            <p>Be it agreed and declared again, that the <hi>Government</hi> be still a <hi>Mixt Government;</hi> and that the Supream Legislative <hi>Power</hi> with all the Rights and <hi>Properties</hi> of it, do, and shall lie in a <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For Gods sake and Your Countries, use your present Advantage; least you mourn the Loss of so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable an offered oppertunity, never to be regaind.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Constitution</hi> (I say) of the <hi>Government</hi> should be considered and declared, and the Power of this <hi>Convention</hi> to dispose of <hi>New Governours</hi> be asserted, before the actual Investiture of Any be concluded, if we resolve to be true Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> or have any Regard to Our Selves, or our Posterity, in a Concern so valuable, as Generations to come shall reap the Blessing of it, and acknowledge the Founders.</p>
